<p><date type="year" year="1866">The year 1866</date> was signalised by a remarkable incident, a mysterious and
puzzling phenomenon, which doubtless no one has yet forgotten. Not to
mention rumours which agitated the maritime population and excited the
public mind, even in the interior of continents, seafaring men were
particularly excited. Merchants, common sailors, captains of vessels,
skippers, both of <place name"Europe" type="country">Europe</place> and <place name"America" type="country">America</place>, naval officers of all countries,
and the Governments of several states on the two continents, were
deeply interested in the matter.</p>

<p>For some time past, vessels had been met by “an enormous thing,” a long
object, spindle-shaped, occasionally phosphorescent, and infinitely
larger and more rapid in its movements than a whale.</p>

<p>The facts relating to this apparition (entered in various log-books)
agreed in most respects as to the shape of the object or creature in
question, the untiring rapidity of its movements, its surprising power
of locomotion, and the peculiar life with which it seemed endowed. If
it was a cetacean, it surpassed in size all those hitherto classified
in science. Taking into consideration the mean of observations made at
divers times,—rejecting the timid estimate of those who assigned to
this object a length of two hundred feet, equally with the exaggerated
opinions which set it down as a mile in width and three in length,—we
might fairly conclude that this mysterious being surpassed greatly all
dimensions admitted by the <clarity word="ichthyologists" meaning="a scientist that specializes in fish.">ichthyologists</clarity> of the day, if it existed at
all. And that it _did_ exist was an undeniable fact; and, with that
tendency which disposes the human mind in favour of the marvellous, we
can understand the excitement produced in the entire world by this
supernatural apparition. As to classing it in the list of fables, the
idea was out of the question.</p>

<p>On the <date type="day" day="July 20th, 1866">20th of July, 1866,</date> the steamer _Governor Higginson_, of the
Calcutta and Burnach Steam Navigation Company, had met this moving mass
five miles off the east coast of Australia. Captain Baker thought at
first that he was in the presence of an unknown sandbank; he even
prepared to determine its exact position, when two columns of water,
projected by the inexplicable object, shot with a hissing noise a
hundred and fifty feet up into the air. Now, unless the sandbank had
been submitted to the intermittent eruption of a geyser, the _Governor
Higginson_ had to do neither more nor less than with an aquatic mammal,
unknown till then, which threw up from its blow-holes columns of water
mixed with air and vapour.</p>

<p>Similar facts were observed on the <date type="day" day="July 23rd, 1866">23rd of July in the same year</date>, in
the Pacific Ocean, by the _Columbus_, of the West India and Pacific
Steam Navigation Company. But this extraordinary cetaceous creature
could transport itself from one place to another with surprising
velocity; as, in an interval of three days, the _Governor Higginson_
and the _Columbus_ had observed it at two different points of the
chart, separated by a distance of more than seven hundred <clarity word="nautical leagues" meaning="a unit of distance, roughly equivalent to three miles.">nautical
leagues</clarity>.</p>

<p><date type="day" day="August 7th, 1866">Fifteen days later</date>, two thousand miles farther off, the _Helvetia_, of
the Compagnie-Nationale, and the _Shannon_, of the Royal Mail Steamship
Company, sailing to windward in that portion of the Atlantic lying
between the <place name="United States" type="country">United States</place> and <place name="Europe" type="country">Europe</place>, respectively signalled the
monster to each other in 42° 15′ N. lat. and 60° 35′ W. long. In these
simultaneous observations they thought themselves justified in
estimating the minimum length of the mammal at more than three hundred
and fifty feet, as the <place name=" The Shannon" type="ship">_Shannon_</place> and <place name=" The Helvetia" type="ship">_Helvetia_</place> were of smaller
dimensions than it, though they measured three hundred feet over all.</p>

<p>Now the largest whales, those which frequent those parts of the sea
round the Aleutian, Kulammak, and Umgullich islands, have never
exceeded the length of sixty yards, if they attain that.</p>

<p>These reports arriving one after the other, with fresh observations
made on board the transatlantic ship _Pereire_, a collision which
occurred between the _Etna_ of the Inman line and the monster, a
_procès verbal_ directed by the officers of the French <clarity word="frigate" meaning="a warship with a mixed armament.">frigate</clarity>
_Normandie_, a very accurate survey made by the staff of Commodore
Fitz-James on board the _Lord Clyde_, greatly influenced public
opinion. Light-thinking people jested upon the phenomenon, but grave
practical countries, such as England, America, and Germany, treated the
matter more seriously.</p>

<p>In every place of great resort the monster was the fashion. They sang
of it in the cafés, ridiculed it in the papers, and represented it on
the stage. All kinds of stories were circulated regarding it. There
appeared in the papers caricatures of every gigantic and imaginary
creature, from the white whale, the terrible “Moby Dick” of hyperborean
regions, to the immense kraken whose tentacles could entangle a ship of
five hundred tons, and hurry it into the abyss of the ocean. The
legends of ancient times were even resuscitated, and the opinions of
Aristotle and Pliny revived, who admitted the existence of these
monsters, as well as the Norwegian tales of Bishop Pontoppidan, the
accounts of Paul Heggede, and, last of all, the reports of Mr.
Harrington (whose good faith no one could suspect), who affirmed that,
being on board the _Castillan_, in <date type="year" year="1857">1857</date>, he had seen this enormous
serpent, which had never until that time frequented any other seas but
those of the ancient “_Constitutionnel_.”</p>

<p>Then burst forth the interminable controversy between the credulous and
the incredulous in the societies of savants and the scientific
journals. “The question of the monster” inflamed all minds. Editors of
scientific journals, quarrelling with believers in the supernatural,
spilled seas of ink during this memorable campaign, some even drawing
blood; for, from the sea-serpent they came to direct personalities.</p>

<p>For six months war was waged with various fortune in the leading
articles of the Geographical Institution of Brazil, the Royal Academy
of Science of Berlin, the British Association, the Smithsonian
Institution of Washington, in the discussions of the “Indian
Archipelago,” of the Cosmos of the Abbé Moigno, in the Mittheilungen of
Petermann, in the scientific chronicles of the great journals of France
and other countries. The cheaper journals replied keenly and with
inexhaustible zest. These satirical writers parodied a remark of
Linnæus, quoted by the adversaries of the monster, maintaining “that
nature did not make fools,” and adjured their contemporaries not to
give the lie to nature, by admitting the existence of krakens,
sea-serpents, “Moby Dicks,” and other lucubrations of delirious
sailors. At length an article in a well-known satirical journal by a
favourite contributor, the chief of the staff, settled the monster,
like Hippolytus, giving it the death-blow amidst an universal burst of
laughter. Wit had conquered science.</p>

<p>During the first months of the year <date type="year" year="1867">1867</date> the question seemed buried,
never to revive, when new facts were brought before the public. It was
then no longer a scientific problem to be solved, but a real danger
seriously to be avoided. The question took quite another shape. The
monster became a small island, a rock, a reef, but a reef of indefinite
and shifting proportions.</p>

<p>On the <date type="day" day="March 5th, 1857">5th of March, 1867</date>, the _Moravian_, of the Montreal Ocean
Company, finding herself during the night in 27° 30′ lat. and 72° 15′
long., struck on her starboard quarter a rock, marked in no chart for
that part of the sea. Under the combined efforts of the wind and its
four hundred horse-power, it was going at the rate of thirteen knots.
Had it not been for the superior strength of the hull of the
_Moravian_, she would have been broken by the shock and gone down with
the 237 passengers she was bringing home from Canada.</p>

<p>The accident happened about five o’clock in the morning, as the day was
breaking. The officers of the quarter-deck hurried to the after-part of
the vessel. They examined the sea with the most scrupulous attention.
They saw nothing but a strong eddy about three cables’ length distant,
as if the surface had been violently agitated. The bearings of the
place were taken exactly, and the _Moravian_ continued its route
without apparent damage. Had it struck on a submerged rock, or on an
enormous wreck? they could not tell; but on examination of the ship’s
bottom when undergoing repairs, it was found that part of her keel was
broken.</p>

<p>This fact, so grave in itself, might perhaps have been forgotten like
many others if, three weeks after, it had not been re-enacted under
similar circumstances. But, thanks to the nationality of the victim of
the shock, thanks to the reputation of the company to which the vessel
belonged, the circumstance became extensively circulated.</p>

<p>The <date type="day" day="April 13th, 1867">13th of April, 1867</date>, the sea being beautiful, the breeze
favourable, the <place name="Scotia" type="ship">_Scotia_</place>, of the Cunard Company’s line, found herself
in 15° 12′ long. and 45° 37′ lat. She was going at the speed of
thirteen knots and a half.</p>

<p>At seventeen minutes past four in the afternoon, whilst the passengers
were assembled at lunch in the great saloon, a slight shock was felt on
the hull of the <place name="Scotia" type="ship">_Scotia_</place>, on her quarter, a little aft of the
port-paddle.</p>

<p>The <place name="Scotia" type="ship">_Scotia_</place> had not struck, but she had been struck, and seemingly by
something rather sharp and penetrating than blunt. The shock had been
so slight that no one had been alarmed, had it not been for the shouts
of the carpenter’s watch, who rushed on to the bridge, exclaiming, “We
are sinking! we are sinking!” At first the passengers were much
frightened, but Captain Anderson hastened to reassure them. The danger
could not be imminent. The <place name="Scotia" type="ship">_Scotia_</place>, divided into seven compartments by
strong partitions, could brave with impunity any leak. Captain Anderson
went down immediately into the hold. He found that the sea was pouring
into the fifth compartment; and the rapidity of the influx proved that
the force of the water was considerable. Fortunately this compartment
did not hold the boilers, or the fires would have been immediately
extinguished. Captain Anderson ordered the engines to be stopped at
once, and one of the men went down to ascertain the extent of the
injury. Some minutes afterwards they discovered the existence of a
large hole, of two yards in diameter, in the ship’s bottom. Such a leak
could not be stopped; and the <place name="Scotia" type="ship">_Scotia_</place>, her paddles half submerged, was
obliged to continue her course. She was then three hundred miles from
Cape Clear, and after three days’ delay, which caused great uneasiness
in Liverpool, she entered the basin of the company.</p>

<p>The engineers visited the <place name="Scotia" type="ship">_Scotia_</place>, which was put in dry dock. They
could scarcely believe it possible; at two yards and a half below
water-mark was a regular rent, in the form of an isosceles triangle.
The broken place in the iron plates was so perfectly defined that it
could not have been more neatly done by a punch. It was clear, then,
that the instrument producing the perforation was not of a common
stamp; and after having been driven with prodigious strength, and
piercing an iron plate 1-3/8 inches thick, had withdrawn itself by a
retrograde motion truly inexplicable.</p>

<p>Such was the last fact, which resulted in exciting once more the
torrent of public opinion. From this moment all unlucky casualties
which could not be otherwise accounted for were put down to the
monster. Upon this imaginary creature rested the responsibility of all
these shipwrecks, which unfortunately were considerable; for of three
thousand ships whose loss was annually recorded at Lloyd’s, the number
of sailing and steam ships supposed to be totally lost, from the
absence of all news, amounted to not less than two hundred!</p>

<p>Now, it was the “monster” who, justly or unjustly, was accused of their
disappearance, and, thanks to it, communication between the different
continents became more and more dangerous. The public demanded
<clarity word="peremptorily" meaning="in a way that expects immediate obedience and allows no room for discussion.">peremptorily</clarity> that the seas should at any price be relieved from this
formidable cetacean.</p>

<chapter n=2><line>CHAPTER II</line>
<line><chapterTitle>PRO AND CON</chapterTitle></line>


<p>At the period when these events took place, I had just returned from a
scientific research in the disagreeable territory of Nebraska, in the
United States. In virtue of my office as Assistant Professor in the
Museum of Natural History in Paris, the French Government had attached
me to that expedition. After six months in Nebraska, I arrived in New
York towards the end of March, laden with a precious collection. My
departure for France was fixed for the first days in May. Meanwhile, I
was occupying myself in classifying my mineralogical, botanical, and
zoological riches, when the accident happened to the <place name="Scotia" type="ship">_Scotia_</place>.</p>

<p>I was perfectly up in the subject which was the question of the day.
How could I be otherwise? I had read and re-read all the American and
European papers without being any nearer a conclusion. This mystery
puzzled me. Under the impossibility of forming an opinion, I jumped
from one extreme to the other. That there really was something could
not be doubted, and the incredulous were invited to put their finger on
the wound of the <place name="Scotia" type="ship">_Scotia_</place>.</p>

<p>On my arrival at <place name="New York" type="city">New York</place> the question was at its height. The
hypothesis of the floating island, and the unapproachable sandbank,
supported by minds little competent to form a judgment, was abandoned.
And, indeed, unless this shoal had a machine in its stomach, how could
it change its position with such astonishing rapidity?</p>

<p>From the same cause, the idea of a floating hull of an enormous wreck
was given up.</p>

<p>There remained then only two possible solutions of the question, which
created two distinct parties: on one side, those who were for a monster
of colossal strength; on the other, those who were for a submarine
vessel of enormous motive power.</p>

<p>But this last hypothesis, plausible as it was, could not stand against
inquiries made in both worlds. That a private gentleman should have
such a machine at his command was not likely. Where, when, and how was
it built? and how could its construction have been kept secret?
Certainly a Government might possess such a destructive machine. And in
these disastrous times, when the ingenuity of man has multiplied the
power of weapons of war, it was possible that, without the knowledge of
others, a state might try to work such a formidable engine. After the
chassepots came the torpedoes, after the torpedoes the submarine rams,
then—the reaction. At least, I hope so.</p>

<p>But the hypothesis of a war machine fell before the declaration of
Governments. As public interest was in question, and transatlantic
communications suffered, their veracity could not be doubted. But, how
admit that the construction of this submarine boat had escaped the
public eye? For a private gentleman to keep the secret under such
circumstances would be very difficult, and for a state whose every act
is persistently watched by powerful rivals, certainly impossible.</p>

<p>After inquiries made in England, France, Russia, Prussia, Spain, Italy,
and America, even in Turkey, the hypothesis of a submarine monitor was
definitely rejected.</p>

<p>Upon my arrival in <place name="New York" type="city">New York</place> several persons did me the honour of
consulting me on the phenomenon in question. I had published in France
a work in <clarity word="quarto" meaning="a book or pamphlet made up of one or more full sheets of paper on which eight pages of text are printed.">quarto</clarity>, in two volumes, entitled “Mysteries of the Great
Submarine Grounds.” This book, highly approved of in the learned world,
gained for me a special reputation in this rather obscure branch of
Natural History. My advice was asked. As long as I could deny the
reality of the fact, I confined myself to a decided negative. But soon,
finding myself driven into a corner, I was obliged to explain myself
categorically. And even “the Honourable <character name="Pierre Aronnax">Pierre Aronnax</character>, Professor in
the Museum of Paris,” was called upon by the <place name="New York" type="city">_New York</place> Herald_ to
express a definite opinion of some sort. I did something. I spoke, for
want of power to hold my tongue. I discussed the question in all its
forms, politically and scientifically; and I give here an extract from
a carefully-studied article which I published in the number of the <date type="day" day="April 30th">30th
of April</date>. It ran as follows:—</p>

<p>“After examining one by one the different hypotheses, rejecting all
other suggestions, it becomes necessary to admit the existence of a
marine animal of enormous power.</p>

<p>“The great depths of the ocean are entirely unknown to us. Soundings
cannot reach them. What passes in those remote depths—what beings live,
or can live, twelve or fifteen miles beneath the surface of the
waters—what is the organisation of these animals, we can scarcely
conjecture. However, the solution of the problem submitted to me may
modify the form of the dilemma. Either we do know all the varieties of
beings which people our planet, or we do not. If we do _not_ know them
all—if Nature has still secrets in <clarity word="ichthyology" meaning="the branch of zoology that studies fish.">ichthyology</clarity> for us, nothing is more
conformable to reason than to admit the existence of fishes, or
cetaceans of other kinds, or even of new species, of an organisation
formed to inhabit the strata inaccessible to soundings, and which an
accident of some sort, either fatastical or capricious, has brought at
long intervals to the upper level of the ocean.</p>

<p>“If, on the contrary, we _do_ know all living kinds, we must
necessarily seek for the animal in question amongst those marine beings
already classed; and, in that case, I should be disposed to admit the
existence of a gigantic narwhal.</p>

<p>“The common narwhal, or unicorn of the sea, often attains a length of
sixty feet. Increase its size fivefold or tenfold, give it strength
proportionate to its size, lengthen its destructive weapons, and you
obtain the animal required. It will have the proportions determined by
the officers of the _Shannon_, the instrument required by the
perforation of the <place name="Scotia" type="ship">_Scotia_</place>, and the power necessary to pierce the hull
of the steamer.</p>

<p><“Indeed, the narwhal is armed with a sort of ivory sword, a <clarity word="halberd" meaning="a combined spear and battleaxe.">halberd</clarity>,
according to the expression of certain naturalists. The principal tusk
has the hardness of steel. Some of these tusks have been found buried
in the bodies of whales, which the unicorn always attacks with success.
Others have been drawn out, not without trouble, from the bottoms of
ships, which they had pierced through and through, as a gimlet pierces
a barrel. The Museum of the Faculty of Medicine of Paris possesses one
of these defensive weapons, two yards and a quarter in length, and
fifteen inches in diameter at the base.</p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Pierre Aronnax">“Very well! suppose this weapon to be six times stronger and the animal
ten times more powerful; launch it at the rate of twenty miles an hour,
and you obtain a shock capable of producing the catastrophe required.
Until further information, therefore, I shall maintain it to be a
sea-unicorn of colossal dimensions, armed not with a <clarity word="halberd" meaning="a combined spear and battleaxe.">halberd</clarity>, but with
a real spur, as the armoured <clarity word="frigate" meaning="a warship with a mixed armament.">frigates</clarity>, or the ‘rams’ of war, whose
massiveness and motive power it would possess at the same time. Thus
may this puzzling phenomenon be explained, unless there be something
over and above all that one has ever conjectured, seen, perceived, or
experienced; which is just within the bounds of possibility.”</dialogue></p>

<p>These last words were cowardly on my part; but, up to a certain point,
I wished to shelter my dignity as Professor, and not give too much
cause for laughter to the Americans, who laugh well when they do laugh.</p>

<p>I reserved for myself a way of escape. In effect, however, I admitted
the existence of the “monster.” My article was warmly discussed, which
procured it a high reputation. It rallied round it a certain number of
partisans. The solution it proposed gave, at least, full liberty to the
imagination. The human mind delights in grand conceptions of
supernatural beings. And the sea is precisely their best vehicle, the
only medium through which these giants (against which terrestrial
animals, such as elephants or rhinoceroses, are as nothing) can be
produced or developed.</p>

<p>The industrial and commercial papers treated the question chiefly from
this point of view. The _Shipping and Mercantile Gazette_, the _Lloyd’s
List_, the _Packet-Boat_, and the _Maritime and Colonial Review_, all
papers devoted to insurance companies which threatened to raise their
rates of premium, were unanimous on this point. Public opinion had been
pronounced. The United States were the first in the field; and in New
York they made preparations for an expedition destined to pursue this
narwhal. A <clarity word="frigate" meaning="a warship with a mixed armament.">frigate</clarity> of great speed, the <place name"Abraham Lincoln" type="ship">_Abraham Lincoln_</place>, was put in
commission as soon as possible. The arsenals were opened to Commander
Farragut, who hastened the arming of his <clarity word="frigate" meaning="a warship with a mixed armament.">frigate</clarity>; but, as it always
happens, the moment it was decided to pursue the monster, the monster
did not appear. For two months no one heard it spoken of. No ship met
with it. It seemed as if this unicorn knew of the plots weaving around
it. It had been so much talked of, even through the Atlantic cable,
that jesters pretended that this slender fly had stopped a telegram on
its passage and was making the most of it.</p>

<p>So when the <clarity word="frigate" meaning="a warship with a mixed armament.">frigate</clarity> had been armed for a long campaign, and provided
with formidable fishing apparatus, no one could tell what course to
pursue. Impatience grew apace, when, on the 2nd of July, they learned
that a steamer of the line of San Francisco, from California to
Shanghai, had seen the animal three weeks before in the North Pacific
Ocean. The excitement caused by this news was extreme. The ship was
revictualled and well stocked with coal.</p>

<p>Three hours before the <place name"Abraham Lincoln" type="ship">_Abraham Lincoln_</place> left Brooklyn pier, I received
a letter worded as follows:—</p>


<p><letter>“To M. ARONNAX, Professor in the Museum of Paris, Fifth Avenue Hotel,
<place name="New York" type="city">New York</place>.</p>

<p>“SIR,—If you will consent to join the <place name"Abraham Lincoln" type="ship">_Abraham Lincoln_</place> in this
expedition, the Government of the United States will with pleasure see
France represented in the enterprise. Commander Farragut has a cabin at
your disposal.</p>


<p><line>“Very cordially yours,</line>
<line>“J.B. HOBSON,</line>
<line>“Secretary of Marine.”</letter></line></p>
</chapter>



<chapter n=3><line>CHAPTER III</line>
<line><chapterTitle>I FORM MY RESOLUTION</chapterTitle></line>


<p>Three seconds before the arrival of <character name="J.B. Hobson">J. B. Hobson</character>’s letter, I no more
thought of pursuing the unicorn than of attempting the passage of the
North Sea. Three seconds after reading the letter of the honourable
Secretary of Marine, I felt that my true vocation, the sole end of my
life, was to chase this disturbing monster, and purge it from the
world.</p>

<p>But I had just returned from a fatiguing journey, weary and longing for
repose. I aspired to nothing more than again seeing my country, my
friends, my little lodging by the Jardin des Plantes, my dear and
precious collections. But nothing could keep me back! I forgot
all—fatigue, friends and collections—and accepted without hesitation
the offer of the American Government.</p>

<p>“Besides,” thought I, “all roads lead back to <place name="Europe" type="country">Europe</place> (for my particular
benefit), and I will not hurry me towards the coast of France. This
worthy animal may allow itself to be caught in the <place name"seas of Europe" type="body of water">seas of Europe</place> (for
my particular benefit), and I will not bring back less than half a yard
of his ivory <clarity word="halberd" meaning="a combined spear and battleaxe.">halberd</clarity> to the Museum of Natural History.” But in the
meanwhile I must seek this narwhal in the North Pacific Ocean, which,
to return to France, was taking the road to the antipodes.</p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Pierre Aronnax">“Conseil,” I called in an impatient voice.</dialogue></p>

<p><character name="Conseil">Conseil was my servant</character>, a true, devoted Flemish boy, who had
accompanied me in all my travels. I liked him, and he returned the
liking well. He was <clarity word="phlegmatic" meaning="having an unemotional and calm disposition.">phlegmatic</clarity> by nature, regular from principle,
zealous from habit, evincing little disturbance at the different
surprises of life, very quick with his hands, and apt at any service
required of him; and, despite his name, never giving advice—even when
asked for it.</p>

<p><character name="Conseil">Conseil</character> had followed me for the last ten years wherever science led.
Never once did he complain of the length or fatigue of a journey, never
make an objection to pack his portmanteau for whatever country it might
be, or however far away, whether China or Congo. Besides all this, he
had good health, which defied all sickness, and solid muscles, but no
nerves; good morals are understood. This boy was thirty years old, and
his age to that of his master as fifteen to twenty. May I be excused
for saying that I was forty years old?</p>

<p>But <character name="Conseil">Conseil</character> had one fault: he was ceremonious to a degree, and would
never speak to me but in the third person, which was sometimes
provoking.</p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Pierre Aronnax">“Conseil,” said I again, beginning with feverish hands to make
preparations for my departure.</dialogue></p>

<p>Certainly I was sure of this devoted boy. As a rule, I never asked him
if it were convenient for him or not to follow me in my travels; but
this time the expedition in question might be prolonged, and the
enterprise might be hazardous in pursuit of an animal capable of
sinking a <clarity word="frigate" meaning="a warship with a mixed armament.">frigate</clarity> as easily as a nutshell. Here there was matter for
reflection even to the most impassive man in the world. What would
Conseil say?</p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Pierre Aronnax">“Conseil,” I called a third time.</dialogue></p>

<p>Conseil appeared.</p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Conseil">“Did you call, sir?” said he, entering.</dialogue></p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Pierre Aronnax">“Yes, my boy; make preparations for me and yourself too. We leave in
two hours.”</dialogue></p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Conseil">“As you please, sir,” replied Conseil, quietly.</dialogue></p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Pierre ARONNAX"“Not an instant to lose;—lock in my trunk all travelling utensils,
coats, shirts, and stockings—without counting, as many as you can, and
make haste.”</p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Conseil">“And your collections, sir?” observed Conseil.</dialogue></p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Pierre Aronnax">“We will think of them by and by.”</p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Conseil">“What! the archiotherium, the hyracotherium, the oreodons, the
cheropotamus, and the other skins?”</dialogue></p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Pierre Aronnax">“They will keep them at the hotel.”</dialogue></p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Conseil">“And your live Babiroussa, sir?”</dialogue></p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Pierre Aronnax">“They will feed it during our absence; besides, I will give orders to
forward our menagerie to France.”</dialogue></p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Conseil">“We are not returning to Paris, then?”</dialogue> said Conseil.</p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Pierre Aronnax">“Oh! certainly,” I answered, evasively, “by making a curve.”</dialogue></p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Conseil">“Will the curve please you, sir?”</dialogue></p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Pierre Aronnax">“Oh! it will be nothing; not quite so direct a road, that is all. We
take our passage in the <place name"Abraham Lincoln" type="ship">_Abraham Lincoln_</place>.”</dialogue></p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Conseil">“As you think proper, sir,” coolly replied Conseil.</dialogue></p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Pierre Aronnax">“You see, my friend, it has to do with the monster—the famous narwhal.
We are going to purge it from the seas. The author of a work in quarto
in two volumes, on the ‘Mysteries of the Great Submarine Grounds’
cannot forbear embarking with Commander Farragut. A glorious mission,
but a dangerous one! We cannot tell where we may go; these animals can
be very capricious. But we will go whether or no; we have got a captain
who is pretty wide-awake.”</dialogue></p>

<p>I opened a credit account for Babiroussa, and, <character name="Conseil">Conseil</character> following, I
jumped into a cab. Our luggage was transported to the deck of the
<clarity word="frigate" meaning="a warship with a mixed armament.">frigate</clarity> immediately. I hastened on board and asked for Commander
Farragut. One of the sailors conducted me to the poop, where I found
myself in the presence of a good-looking officer, who held out his hand
to me.</p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Commander Farragut">“Monsieur Pierre Aronnax?” said he.</dialogue></p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Pierre Aronnax">“Himself,” replied I; “Commander Farragut?”</dialogue></p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Commander Farragut">“You are welcome, Professor; your cabin is ready for you.”</dialogue></p>

<p>I bowed, and desired to be conducted to the cabin destined for me.</p>

<p>The <place name"Abraham Lincoln" type="ship">_Abraham Lincoln_</place> had been well chosen and equipped for her new
destination. She was a <clarity word="frigate" meaning="a warship with a mixed armament.">frigate</clarity> of great speed, fitted with
high-pressure engines which admitted a pressure of seven atmospheres.
Under this the <place name"Abraham Lincoln" type="ship">_Abraham Lincoln_</place> attained the mean speed of nearly
eighteen knots and a third an hour—a considerable speed, but,
nevertheless, insufficient to grapple with this <clarity word="gigantic cetacean" meaning="a very large or enormous whale, dolphin, or porpoise.">gigantic cetacean.</clarity></p>

<p>The interior arrangements of the <clarity word="frigate" meaning="a warship with a mixed armament.">frigate</clarity> corresponded to its nautical
qualities. I was well satisfied with my cabin, which was in the after
part, opening upon the gunroom.</p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Pierre Aronnax">“We shall be well off here,” said I to Conseil.</dialogue></p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Conseil">“As well, by your honour’s leave, as a hermit-crab in the shell of a
whelk,” said Conseil.</dialogue></p>

<p>I left Conseil to stow our trunks conveniently away, and remounted the
poop in order to survey the preparations for departure.</p>

<p>At that moment Commander Farragut was ordering the last moorings to be
cast loose which held the <place name"Abraham Lincoln" type="ship">_Abraham Lincoln_</place> to the pier of Brooklyn. So
in a quarter of an hour, perhaps less, the <clarity word="frigate" meaning="a warship with a mixed armament.">frigate</clarity> would have sailed
without me. I should have missed this extraordinary, supernatural, and
incredible expedition, the recital of which may well meet with some
scepticism.</p>

<p>But Commander Farragut would not lose a day nor an hour in scouring the
seas in which the animal had been sighted. He sent for the engineer.</p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Commander Farragut">“Is the steam full on?” asked he.</dialogue></p>

<p><dialogue speaker="engineer">“Yes, sir,” replied the engineer.</dialogue></p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Commander Farragut">“Go ahead,” cried Commander Farragut.</dialogue></p>

<p>The quay of Brooklyn, and all that part of <place name="New York" type="city">New York</place> bordering on the
East River, was crowded with spectators. Three cheers burst
successively from five hundred thousand throats; thousands of
handkerchiefs were waved above the heads of the compact mass, saluting
the <place name"Abraham Lincoln" type="ship">_Abraham Lincoln_</place>, until she reached the waters of the Hudson, at
the point of that elongated peninsula which forms the town of <place name="New York" type="city">New York</place>.
Then the <clarity word="frigate" meaning="a warship with a mixed armament.">frigate</clarity>, following the coast of New Jersey along the right
bank of the beautiful river, covered with villas, passed between the
forts, which saluted her with their heaviest guns. The <place name"Abraham Lincoln" type="ship">_Abraham
Lincoln_</place> answered by hoisting the American colours three times, whose
thirty-nine stars shone resplendent from the mizzen-peak; then
modifying its speed to take the narrow channel marked by buoys placed
in the inner bay formed by Sandy Hook Point, it coasted the long sandy
beach, where some thousands of spectators gave it one final cheer. The
escort of boats and tenders still followed the <clarity word="frigate" meaning="a warship with a mixed armament.">frigate</clarity>, and did not
leave her until they came abreast of the lightship, whose two lights
marked the entrance of <place name="New York Channel" type="body of water">New York Channel</place>.</p>

<p>Six bells struck, the pilot got into his boat, and rejoined the little
schooner which was waiting under our lee, the fires were made up, the
screw beat the waves more rapidly, the <clarity word="frigate" meaning="a warship with a mixed armament.">frigate</clarity> skirted the low yellow
coast of Long Island; and at eight bells, after having lost sight in
the north-west of the lights of Fire Island, she ran at full steam on
to the dark waters of the Atlantic.</p>

<chapter n=4><line>CHAPTER IV</line>
<line><chapterTitle>NED LAND</chapterTitle></line>


<p><character name="Captain Farragut">Captain Farragut</character> was a good seaman, worthy of the <clarity word="frigate" meaning="a warship with a mixed armament.">frigate</clarity> he commanded.
His vessel and he were one. He was the soul of it. On the question of
the cetacean there was no doubt in his mind, and he would not allow the
existence of the animal to be disputed on board. He believed in it, as
certain good women believe in the leviathan—by faith, not by reason.
The monster did exist, and he had sworn to rid the seas of it. He was a
kind of Knight of Rhodes, a second Dieudonné de Gozon, going to meet
the serpent which desolated the island. Either <character name="Captain Farragut">Captain Farragut</character> would
kill the narwhal, or the narwhal would kill the captain. There was no
third course.</p>

<p>The officers on board shared the opinion of their chief. They were ever
chatting, discussing, and calculating the various chances of a meeting,
watching narrowly the vast surface of the ocean. More than one took up
his quarters voluntarily in the cross-trees, who would have cursed such
a berth under any other circumstances. As long as the sun described its
daily course, the rigging was crowded with sailors, whose feet were
burnt to such an extent by the heat of the deck as to render it
unbearable; still the <place name"Abraham Lincoln" type="ship">_Abraham Lincoln_</place> had not yet breasted the
suspected waters of the Pacific. As to the ship’s company, they desired
nothing better than to meet the unicorn, to harpoon it, hoist it on
board, and despatch it. They watched the sea with eager attention.</p>

<p>Besides, <character name="Captain Farragut">Captain Farragut</character> had spoken of a certain sum of two thousand
dollars, set apart for whoever should first sight the monster, were he
cabin-boy, common seaman, or officer.</p>

<p>I leave you to judge how eyes were used on board the <place name"Abraham Lincoln" type="ship">_Abraham Lincoln_</place>.</p>

<p>For my own part I was not behind the others, and left to no one my
share of daily observations. The <clarity word="frigate" meaning="a warship with a mixed armament.">frigate</clarity> might have been called the
_Argus_, for a hundred reasons. Only one amongst us, Conseil, seemed to
protest by his indifference against the question which so interested us
all, and seemed to be out of keeping with the general enthusiasm on
board.</p>

<p>I have said that <character name="Captain Farragut">Captain Farragut</character> had carefully provided his ship with
every apparatus for catching the <clarity word="gigantic cetacean" meaning="a very large or enormous whale, dolphin, or porpoise.">gigantic cetacean</clarity>. No whaler had ever
been better armed. We possessed every known engine, from the harpoon
thrown by the hand to the barbed arrows of the blunderbuss, and the
explosive balls of the duck-gun. On the forecastle lay the perfection
of a breech-loading gun, very thick at the breech, and very narrow in
the bore, the model of which had been in the Exhibition of <date type="year" year="1867">1867</date>. This
precious weapon of American origin could throw with ease a conical
projectile of nine pounds to a mean distance of ten miles.</p>

<p>Thus the <place name"Abraham Lincoln" type="ship">_Abraham Lincoln_</place> wanted for no means of destruction; and,
what was better still, she had on board Ned Land, the prince of
harpooners.</p>

<p>Ned Land was a Canadian, with an uncommon quickness of hand, and who
knew no equal in his dangerous occupation. Skill, coolness, audacity,
and cunning he possessed in a superior degree, and it must be a cunning
whale or a singularly “cute” cachalot to escape the stroke of his
harpoon.</p>

<p>Ned Land was about forty years of age; he was a tall man (more than six
feet high), strongly built, grave and taciturn, occasionally violent,
and very passionate when contradicted. His person attracted attention,
but above all the boldness of his look, which gave a singular
expression to his face.</p>

<p>Who calls himself Canadian calls himself French; and, little
communicative as Ned Land was, I must admit that he took a certain
liking for me. My nationality drew him to me, no doubt. It was an
opportunity for him to talk, and for me to hear, that old language of
Rabelais, which is still in use in some Canadian provinces. The
harpooner’s family was originally from Quebec, and was already a tribe
of hardy fishermen when this town belonged to France.</p>

<p>Little by little, Ned Land acquired a taste for chatting, and I loved
to hear the recital of his adventures in the polar seas. He related his
fishing, and his combats, with natural poetry of expression; his
recital took the form of an epic poem, and I seemed to be listening to
a Canadian Homer singing the Iliad of the regions of the North.</p>

<p>I am portraying this hardy companion as I really knew him. We are old
friends now, united in that unchangeable friendship which is born and
cemented amidst extreme dangers. Ah, brave Ned! I ask no more than to
live a hundred years longer, that I may have more time to dwell the
longer on your memory.</p>

<p>Now, what was <character name="Ned Land">Ned Land</character>’s opinion upon the question of the marine
monster? I must admit that he did not believe in the unicorn, and was
the only one on board who did not share that universal conviction. He
even avoided the subject, which I one day thought it my duty to press
upon him. One magnificent evening, the 30th of July—that is to say,
three weeks after our departure—the <clarity word="frigate" meaning="a warship with a mixed armament.">frigate</clarity> was abreast of Cape Blanc,
thirty miles to leeward of the coast of Patagonia. We had crossed the
tropic of Capricorn, and the Straits of Magellan opened less than seven
hundred miles to the south. Before eight days were over the <place name"Abraham Lincoln" type="ship">_Abraham
Lincoln_</place> would be ploughing the waters of the Pacific.</p>

<p>Seated on the poop, Ned Land and I were chatting of one thing and
another as we looked at this mysterious sea, whose great depths had up
to this time been inaccessible to the eye of man. I naturally led up
the conversation to the giant unicorn, and examined the various chances
of success or failure of the expedition. But, seeing that Ned Land let
me speak without saying too much himself, I pressed him more closely.</p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Pierre Aronnax">“Well, Ned,” said I, “is it possible that you are not convinced of the
existence of this cetacean that we are following? Have you any
particular reason for being so incredulous?”</dialogue></p>

<p>The harpooner looked at me fixedly for some moments before answering,
struck his broad forehead with his hand (a habit of his), as if to
collect himself, and said at last, <dialogue speaker="Ned Land">“Perhaps I have, M. Aronnax.”</dialogue></p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Pierre Aronnax">“But, Ned, you, a whaler by profession, familiarised with all the great
marine mammalia—you, whose imagination might easily accept the
hypothesis of enormous cetaceans, _you_ ought to be the last to doubt
under such circumstances!”</dialogue></p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Ned land">“That is just what deceives you, Professor,” replied Ned. “That the
vulgar should believe in extraordinary comets traversing space, and in
the existence of antediluvian monsters in the heart of the globe, may
well be; but neither astronomer nor geologist believes in such
chimeras. As a whaler I have followed many a cetacean, harpooned a
great number, and killed several; but, however strong or well-armed
they may have been, neither their tails nor their weapons would have
been able even to scratch the iron plates of a steamer.”</dialogue></p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Pierre Aronnax">“But, Ned, they tell of ships which the teeth of the narwhal have
pierced through and through.”</dialogue></p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Ned Land">“Wooden ships—that is possible,” replied the Canadian, “but I have
never seen it done; and, until further proof, I deny that whales,
cetaceans, or sea-unicorns could ever produce the effect you describe.”</dialogue></p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Pierre Aronnax">“Well, Ned, I repeat it with a conviction resting on the logic of
facts. I believe in the existence of a mammal powerfully organised,
belonging to the branch of vertebrata, like the whales, the cachalots,
or the dolphins, and furnished with a horn of defence of great
penetrating power.”</dialogue></p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Ned Land">“Hum!” said the harpooner, shaking his head with the air of a man who
would not be convinced.</dialogue></p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Pierre Aronnax">“Notice one thing, my worthy Canadian,” I resumed. “If such an animal
is in existence, if it inhabits the depths of the ocean, if it
frequents the strata lying miles below the surface of the water, it
must necessarily possess an organisation the strength of which would
defy all comparison.”</dialogue></p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Ned Land">“And why this powerful organisation?”</dialogue> demanded Ned.</p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Pierre Aronnax">“Because it requires incalculable strength to keep one’s self in these
strata and resist their pressure. Listen to me. Let us admit that the
pressure of the atmosphere is represented by the weight of a column of
water thirty-two feet high. In reality the column of water would be
shorter, as we are speaking of sea water, the density of which is
greater than that of fresh water. Very well, when you dive, Ned, as
many times thirty-two feet of water as there are above you, so many
times does your body bear a pressure equal to that of the atmosphere,
that is to say, 15 lbs. for each square inch of its surface. It
follows, then, that at 320 feet this pressure = that of 10 atmospheres,
of 100 atmospheres at 3200 feet, and of 1000 atmospheres at 32,000
feet, that is, about 6 miles; which is equivalent to saying that if you
could attain this depth in the ocean, each square three-eighths of an
inch of the surface of your body would bear a pressure of 5600 lbs. Ah!
my brave Ned, do you know how many square inches you carry on the
surface of your body?”</dialogue></p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Ned Land">“I have no idea, M. Aronnax.”</dialogue></p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Pierre Aronnax">“About 6500; and, as in reality the atmospheric pressure is about 15
lbs. to the square inch, your 6500 square inches bear at this moment a
pressure of 97,500 lbs.”</dialogue></p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Ned Land">“Without my perceiving it?”</dialogue></p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Pierre Aronnax">“Without your perceiving it. And if you are not crushed by such a
pressure, it is because the air penetrates the interior of your body
with equal pressure. Hence perfect equilibrium between the interior and
exterior pressure, which thus neutralise each other, and which allows
you to bear it without inconvenience. But in the water it is another
thing.”</dialogue></p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Ned Land">“Yes, I understand,” replied Ned, becoming more attentive; “because the
water surrounds me, but does not penetrate.”</dialogue></p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Pierre Aronnax">“Precisely, Ned: so that at 32 feet beneath the surface of the sea you
would undergo a pressure of 97,500 lbs.; at 320 feet, ten times that
pressure; at 3200 feet, a hundred times that pressure; lastly, at
32,000 feet, a thousand times that pressure would be 97,500,000
lbs.—that is to say, that you would be flattened as if you had been
drawn from the plates of a hydraulic machine!”</dialogue></p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Ned Land">“The devil!” exclaimed Ned.</dialogue></p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Pierre Aronnax">“Very well, my worthy harpooner, if some vertebrate, several hundred
yards long, and large in proportion, can maintain itself in such
depths—of those whose surface is represented by millions of square
inches, that is by tens of millions of pounds, we must estimate the
pressure they undergo. Consider, then, what must be the resistance of
their bony structure, and the strength of their organisation to
withstand such pressure!”</dialogue></p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Ned Land">“Why!” exclaimed Ned Land, “they must be made of iron plates eight
inches thick, like the armoured <clarity word="frigate" meaning="a warship with a mixed armament.">frigates</clarity>.”</dialogue></p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Pierre Aronnax">“As you say, Ned. And think what destruction such a mass would cause,
if hurled with the speed of an express train against the hull of a
vessel.”</dialogue></p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Ned Land">“Yes—certainly—perhaps,” replied the Canadian, shaken by these figures,
but not yet willing to give in.</dialogue></p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Pierre Aronnax">“Well, have I convinced you?”</dialogue></p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Ned Land">“You have convinced me of one thing, sir, which is that, if such
animals do exist at the bottom of the seas, they must necessarily be as
strong as you say.”<dialogue></p>

<p><dialogue speaker="Pierre Aronnax">“But if they do not exist, mine obstinate harpooner, how explain the
accident to the _Scotia?_”</dialogue></p>
