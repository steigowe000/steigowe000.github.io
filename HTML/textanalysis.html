    <h1>Text Analysis Project Information</h1>
    <h2>Reading Jules Verne Texts Through Text Encoding and Voyant</h2>
<p>Within the text analysis project, I chose to mark up a number or elements to understand both
clarity and characters on a deeper level. For my project, I chose a section of Jules Verne’s 20,000
Leagues Under the Sea, which was published in 1870. The language used in the novel differs
significantly in complexity and use from today’s language, so I marked-up any significant words
that caused any form of confusion or difficulty when reading through the text. I chose to
highlight the frontmatter, including the author and title, and the sections of chapter breaks. I also
chose to put an emphasis on chapter titles, chapter numbers, and the line breaks included for
each. I highlighted dates, specifying whether the dates listed were exact days or more vague
years. I chose to include mark-ups for dialogue, with special notes for which speakers are
involved in the conversation. I also chose to highlight characters, specifying their names and in
some cases their significance to the remainder of the story. Other important elements that I
marked up were the end section, section breaks, places and settings (with ships and names
included), and the body section of the document. All these tags help with clarity for readers,
ensuring that the difference in time does not create an obstacle for readers.</p>

<h3>Example of Mark-Up for Clarity:</h3>
<code>The &lt;place name="Abraham Lincoln" type="ship"&gt;_Abraham Lincoln_&lt;/place&gt; had been well chosen and equipped for her new
destination. She was a &lt;clarity word="frigate" meaning="a warship with a mixed armament."&gt;frigate&lt;/clarity&gt; of great speed, fitted with
high-pressure engines which admitted a pressure of seven atmospheres.
Under this the &lt;place name"Abraham Lincoln" type="ship"&gt;_Abraham Lincoln_&lt;/place&gt; attained the mean speed of nearly
eighteen knots and a third an hour—a considerable speed, but,
nevertheless, insufficient to grapple with this &lt;clarity word="gigantic cetacean" meaning="a very large or enormous whale, dolphin, or porpoise."&gt;gigantic cetacean.&lt;/clarity&gt;</code>

<p>The importance of this project cannot be overstated, as understanding past literature can help
create future creativity. Jules Verne is known worldwide for his work in science-fiction and is
known as one of the most significant figures in science fiction history. He is listed as one of the
fathers of science fiction, along with H.G. Wells and H.P. Lovecraft. His work was revolutionary
and is still widely praised, with many of his works being adapted into films and television shows.
More specifically regarding the assignment, I gained a new understanding of Jules Verne’s work.
Previously, I have found his work to be difficult to understand and comprehend, as well as
overall challenging to follow. By breaking down tough words and adding clarity to old-English, I
gained a new understanding and appreciation for his work. Another important area where I
gained knowledge was his crafting of dialogue, especially between just two people. When
writing, I find difficulty in creating engaging dialogue especially when the conversation is only
between two people. Being able to analyze and observe the crafting of engaging dialogue has
helped me understand dialogue on a deeper level. By marking dates and settings, I have
uncovered some of the complexity of crafting a setting for a novel, and some of the inner
workings of setting a tone for a story. Verne is well known for crafting a setting that compels an
audience to read further, and this segment of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea is no exception.
Using sea lingo such as “frigate” adds complexity to the story and allows for the reader to be
fully immersed. The assignment has given me the opportunity to analyze the creation of a
thrilling story that motivates the reader to read on, and realistic immersion is a massive part of
that. Another area that is an interesting addition to my understanding of the project is the use of
chapter breaks, which is a significant identifier of suspense in a story. Suspense is one of the
most difficult, yet rewarding areas of writing to create, and analyzing Verne’s work has allowed
me to view a historical piece that is widely regarded to be suspenseful in nature. By reading and
marking up the assignment, I have come to appreciate the great work that has come before and
for much of my life has been difficult to comprehend.</p>
