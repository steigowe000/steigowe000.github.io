    <h1>Gamemaking Project Information</h1>
    <p>The purpose behind the creation of "Expecition Argaron" stems from the idea of American imperialism, and the negative impacts on Americans that this idea can have.
      Within the game, the United States government pushes for a survey team to explore a new neighboring planet. America's destruction of their own planet leads to a need
      for an expedition. American imperialism is especially important in today's society because of the current tensions between the United States and Canada, mostly caused by comments made
      by the United States president. These tensions have led to economic shifts, threats of tariffs, and other major impacts. American imperialism has been a cause for concern for more than 200
      years, as evidenced by conflicts during the Mexican-American war, the war in the Philippines, and others.

      During the course of the game, you are given decisions that lead to important events, such as where to create structures, who to put faith in, and where to hide in the event of a disaster.
      These decisions are created to show the negative impacts that imperialism can have, as well as the disregard that America has for its own people, at times. The government shipped citizens
      to a foreign planet without the processes necessary to determine if it was safe, and the conditions prove to be fatal in some instances. Also, in certain scenarios, the government does
      not prioritize the stranded astronauts health.

      There are also moral implications during the course of the game, including putting the wellfare of the crewmates above the user's, ensuring their safety, and providing food and water. If
      these areas are not completed sufficiently, the team could turn on the user or each other. At certain points, the user is given a decision to protect the team during tense moments, or attack
      the crewmates before they attack you. These scenarios mirror the greed and selfishness in society, with many people prioritizing themselves over the health of friends, family, and loved ones.
      Hopefully, the playthrough of the game will help determine some form of moral clarity, especially if the user has a strong moral code.

      Overall, the project was engaging and enjoyable. The work was difficult at times, but it was important to learn to program using Twine. CSS is still sometimes difficult for me to grasp, but I feel that
      I have come a long way with digital programming and hope to move further in the future. The game was not as developed as I originally hoped, but the difficulty of creating a complex game with as many variables
      and decisions as required from my proposal outweighed the amount of work possible. The project became complicated when the variables overlapped, essentially creating situations where "Communications is 1" but also "Weapons is 1". These situations
      were often required during the creation of the game because scenarios were implicated by previous decisions. Overall, I overcame these difficulties and am happy with the outcome.</p>
