          <h2>Changes and What I Learned</h2>
          <p>For the rebuilding Elizabot assignment, I decided to shift the original viewpoint of a therapist-type AI bot to a more entertaining view.
          I changed the JavaScript coding to have Eliza representing a Pokemon professor giving tips and information for new Pokemon trainers. The information that I provided includes
          favorite games in the franchise, types and their advantages/disadvantages, as well as information on starter Pokemon. Although the bot is not as fleshed out as possible, it
          is an introduction to the possibilities of AI and the information related to games. The project was difficult to complete because of the complex JavaScript language, as well as
          as the amount of information that I had to include, but I found it more engaging and entertaining than I originally thought it would be. Despite the difficulties, the
          work was enjoyable to complete and helped me understand the language further than I have in the past.</p>

          <p>The Eliza bot was given a number of responses based on the wording and structure of the response posed, such as 'Pokemon' giving a response regarding the Podedex, while a response
            of 'How do I play Pokemon' will give a differing response regarding the rules and structure of the game. There was also information provided about starters and other important elements
            of the games. The Eliza bot's name was changed to 'Professor Eliza' and the script regarding therapy and feelings was instead replaced fully with information of Pokemon. </p>
